# Comparing Classifiers

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various factors such as personal attributes, contact history, and economic indicators.

The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected from a Portuguese banking institutionâ€™s telemarketing campaigns.

## Key Findings

- **Influence of previous contacts**: Customers who had successful previous campaigns are more likely to subscribe.
- **Economic indicators matter**: Features like the Euribor 3-month rate and employment variation rate have a strong correlation with subscription likelihood.
- **Call duration is a strong predictor**: However, it should not be used for realistic predictive models, as it is only known after a call is completed.
- **Class imbalance**: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a majority of customers not subscribing to term deposits.

## Recommendations

- **Target customers with previous positive engagements** to improve campaign efficiency.
- **Leverage economic conditions**: Optimizing campaign timing based on favorable economic indicators can boost subscription rates.
- **Address class imbalance**: Using techniques like oversampling, SMOTE, or adjusting class weights can improve model performance.

These insights provide actionable strategies for banks to optimize their telemarketing campaigns and increase customer conversions.
