Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various factors such as personal attributes, contact history, and economic indicators.

The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected from a Portuguese banking institutionâ€™s telemarketing campaigns.

Key Findings

Influence of previous contacts: Customers who had successful previous campaigns are more likely to subscribe.

Economic indicators matter: Features like the Euribor 3-month rate and employment variation rate have a strong correlation with subscription likelihood.

Call duration is a strong predictor: However, it should not be used for realistic predictive models, as it is only known after a call is completed.

Class imbalance: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a majority of customers not subscribing to term deposits.

Recommendations

Target customers with previous positive engagements to improve campaign efficiency.

Leverage economic conditions: Optimizing campaign timing based on favorable economic indicators can boost subscription rates.

Address class imbalance: Using techniques like oversampling, SMOTE, or adjusting class weights can improve model performance.
